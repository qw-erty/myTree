                  As the biggest plants on the planet, they give us oxygen,
                  store carbon, stabilise the soil and give life to the world’s
                  wildlife. They also provide us with the materials for tools
                  and shelter. Not only are trees essential for life, but as the
                  longest living species on earth, they give us a link between
                  the past, present and future. It’s critical that woodlands,
                  rainforests and trees in urban settings, such as parks, are
                  preserved and sustainably managed across the world. Play your
                  part and donate to The Royal Parks today to help us manage
                  these vital trees in London's Royal Parks.

                  The canopies of trees act as a physical filter, trapping dust
                  and absorbing pollutants from the air. Each individual tree
                  removes up to 1.7 kilos every year. They also provide shade
                  from solar radiation and reduce noise. Over 20 species of
                  British trees and shrubs are known to have medicinal
                  properties. The oil from birch bark, for example, has
                  antiseptic properties. Research shows that within minutes of
                  being surrounded by trees and green space, your blood pressure
                  drops, your heart rate slows and your stress levels come down.

                  Trees absorb carbon dioxide as they grow and the carbon that
                  they store in their wood helps slow the rate of global
                  warming. They reduce wind speeds and cool the air as they lose
                  moisture and reflect heat upwards from their leaves. It’s
                  estimated that trees can reduce the temperature in a city by
                  up to 7°C. Trees also help prevent flooding and soil erosion,
                  absorbing thousands of litres of stormwater.

                  Trees host complex microhabitats. When young, they offer
                  habitation and food to amazing communities of birds, insects,
                  lichen and fungi. When ancient, their trunks also provide the
                  hollow cover needed by species such as bats, woodboring
                  beetles, tawny owls and woodpeckers. One mature oak can be
                  home to as many as 500 different species. Richmond Park is
                  full of such trees, which is one of the reasons it has been
                  designated a National Nature Reserve and Site of Special
                  Scientific Interest

                  Trees strengthen the distinctive character of a place and
                  encourage local pride. Urban woodland can be used as an
                  educational resource and to bring groups together for
                  activities like walking and bird-watching. Trees are also
                  invaluable for children to play in and discover their sense of
                  adventure.

                  Soon, for the first time in history, the number of people with
