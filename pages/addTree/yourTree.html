        pine family (Pinaceae), distributed throughout the world but native primarily to northern temperate regions. The
        chief economic value of pines is in the construction and paper-products industries, but they are also sources of
        turpentine, rosin, oils, and wood tars. Edible pine seeds, which are sold commercially as pine nuts, piñons, or
        pinyons, are produced by several species. Many pines are cultivated as ornamentals, including black, white,
        Himalayan, and stone pines, and some are planted in reforestation projects or for windbreaks. Pine-leaf oil,
        used medicinally, is a distillation product of the leaves; charcoal, lampblack, and fuel gases are distillation
        by-products.
