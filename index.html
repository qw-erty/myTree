       <h5><strong>Name:</strong> Pine Tree</h5>
      <h5><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> Pinus sylvestris</h5>
      <br>
      <h6><strong>Description:</strong> Pine, (genus Pinus), genus of about 120 species of evergreen conifers of the pine family (Pinaceae), distributed throughout the world but native primarily to northern temperate regions. The chief economic value of pines is in the construction and paper-products industries, but they are also sources of turpentine, rosin, oils, and wood tars. Edible pine seeds, which are sold commercially as pine nuts, piñons, or pinyons, are produced by several species. Many pines are cultivated as ornamentals, including black, white, Himalayan, and stone pines, and some are planted in reforestation projects or for windbreaks. Pine-leaf oil, used medicinally, is a distillation product of the leaves; charcoal, lampblack, and fuel gases are distillation by-products.
